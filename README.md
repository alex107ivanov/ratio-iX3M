# Data connector of Ratio iX3M

<img src="connector.jpg">

To charge dive computer you need only GND and +5V connection.
For communication you need only GND Tx & Rx pins. Original cable based on FT230X chip, I checked data connection with CP2102 - subsurface successfully imported data.

I'm going to add some STL files for protective case & data connector.
